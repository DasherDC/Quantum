The example in this directory illustrates the convergence test
with respect to plane wave cutoff energy for FCC Cu. The lattice
parameter of the primitive cell is set to that of the experimental value.

To run this example, simply invoke:
   ./run

Once the calculation is done, you should find a new file named
   eng_cut.dat
in your directory.

Invoke
   ../../0-tools/check_conv_ecut
to check the the energy of the system as a function of cutoff energy.


You can modify the file of "run" to use a different cutoff energy range
to test the convergence w.r.t cutoff energy.

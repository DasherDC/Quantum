The example in this directory illustrates the single point energy
calculation for FCC Cu with converged k-mesh and cutoff energy. The lattice
parameter of the primitive cell is set to that of the experimental value.

To run this example, simply invoke:
   ./run
or
   vasp

You can compare the energy from the current run with that in the 1st example by:
  grep 'free  energy' ../../1-single-point-fcc-Cu/OUTCAR
  grep 'free  energy' OUTCAR

The 1st one will give you the final free energy for calculation without convergence
test, and the 2nd one will give you that for the current run.

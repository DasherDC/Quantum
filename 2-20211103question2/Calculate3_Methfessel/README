The example in this directory illustrates the calculation of lattice
constant of FCC Cu by scanning.

To run this example, simply invoke:
   ./run

Once the calculation is done, you should find a new file named
   eng_a.dat
in your directory, which contains the 
1) volume per atom of the cell;
2) total energy of the system, eV/cell;
3) lattice parameter;
4) time used for the calculation.

Invoke
   ../0-tools/eos_fit
to fit the calculated volume-energy data to the Murnagham's Equation of State
and derive the equilibrium volume, energy, bulk modulus of the material.

You can modify the file of "run" to use a different lattice parameter range.
Also, one can modify the following files for the calculation of a different
system:
1) INCAR, if needed;
2) run, to define the lattice and crystal;
3) KPOINTS, if needed;
4) POTCAR, must be the one that corresponds to the elements in your new crystal.
